 	              <P> A microprocessor is basically the brain of the computer. We can also call it simply a processor or CPU. Furthermore, a microprocessor is basically a computer processor that is mounted on a single IC (Integrated Circuit). It means that all the functions of the processor are included on a single chip. In 1971, Intel introduced the first commercial microprocessor which was Intel 4004.Furthermore, the basic task of a microprocessor is to input the instructions from the memory, decode, and process them and produce the output.</P><a href="https://www.toppr.com/guides/computer-science/computer-fundamentals/microprocessor/basic-concepts-of-microprocessor/" style="color: orange"> read more</a><br>

 	              <P> Alternatively called an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in<b> 1904</b>. The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. The picture shows a collection of different vacuum tubes used with different device.By using vacuum tubes instead of mechanical relays, computers could move away from mechanical switching and speed up switching on and off the flow of electrons. Vacuum tubes were also used in radios, televisions, radar equipment, and telephone systems during the first half of the 1900s.<br><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/vacuumtu.htm" style="color: orange">read more</a>

 	              <p>Sensor technology and design, according to Deloitte, will gravitate towards applications. Within each application, new and better technology will emerge to serve them. For example, acoustic sensors "are in development that help recognize audio vibration or frequency to determine activity, location, and intensity," explains Deloitte. Additionally, sensors in a chemical environment are being developed to "perform complex tasks such as the measurement of fluid composition and concentration of biological and chemical compounds," they says.Naturally, there are other applications that will vary, depending upon need and usage; but we can only expect that sensors will be developed to work in severe and harsh environments, have a boost in performance, and are designed for security as well as enterprise usage and need.</p><a href="https://blog.smartsense.co/evolution-sensor-technology" style="color: orange">read more</a><br><embed style="width: 300px; height: 150px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XI49uFm5HRE"></embed>

 	              <P>
 	              ARM processors are a family of central processing units (CPUs) based on a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture. ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine. ARM architectures represent a different approach to how the hardware for a system is designed when compared to more familiar server architectures like x86.The ARM ecosystem has emerged over the last several years with server optimized products and solutions that are designed for cloud and hyperscale computing, telecommunications, and edge computing, as well as high-performance computing (HPC) applications. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-arm-processor" style="color: orange">read more</a><br><embed style="width: 300px; height: 250px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4BxUiqWq8E"></embed>
